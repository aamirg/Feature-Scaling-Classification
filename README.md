#### Familiarize myself with Feature Scaling, its advantages, using sci-kit learn modules to accomplish it, and compare accuracy for the raw & scaled dataset. There isn't a large difference in accuracy for the two as the dataset is well-balanced and has a small sample size, but feature scaling is extremely beneficial as it reduces training time and prevents the optimization function from getting stuck at local optima
